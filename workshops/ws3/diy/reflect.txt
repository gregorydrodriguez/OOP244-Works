Public/Private Members & Methods

    When creating a class all members and methods are private by default. Private members can't be accessed unless you use a public method (you can use other functions within public methods
as well). You can access private members only within the class itself.

iostream/std namespace

    Usage of cout and endl. cout outputs to console, and endl creates a newline as well as clearing the buffer.

const functions

    const functions do not change the value of class members
