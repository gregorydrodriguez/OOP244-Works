ws2 involved overloading functions, dynamic memory, and deallocating memory

overloading consists of a multiple function declarations with the same indentifier, but
different parameters (in some cases no parameters) and different order of parameters.

dynamic memory is created when we use the "new" keyword. The operating system determines where that
memory is (aka allocating memory).

deallocating memory. An easy rule to go by is to "delete" (delete [] for arrays) for any type that
was declared with the "new" keyword. You have to delete each property as well as the structure. If the
structure has multiple indices, you can implement a loop to deleter each index.
