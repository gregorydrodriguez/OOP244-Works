WS9 Derived Classes & Resources
In this workshop we had a parent/base class (Text) and a child/derived class (HtmlText).

Copy Constructor via Derived Classes (Rule of 3)
The syntax for the derived class' copy constructor is to make a small addition to the signature
via the definition, ex. derivedIdentifier(classReference derivedObject) : baseIdentifier(derivedObject).
To access the private members of the base class you must prefix the derived constructor with a ':'
character followed by the base constructor.

Copy Assignment via Derived Classes (Rule of 3)
The copy assignment must be explicit when assigning private members within the base class. The 
derived class must explicitly call the base classes overload operator for '=', in this lab, 
to achieve this.

Destructor via Derived Classes (Rule of 3)
There is nothing different with the destructor, but the base destructor must be virtual.

Protected
The protected specifier allows members to be visible within the class and visible to derived
classes.
