Abstract Classes and Virtual Functions

Abstract classes are similar to blueprints for concrete classes (derived from abstract classes).
The abstract class implements virtual functions are functions that a concrete class will inherit
from the base/abstract class. This is useful in this workshop as we want our rectangle, and line
classes to behave in different ways.
