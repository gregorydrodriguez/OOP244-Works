Workshop 5 - DIY

Type Conversion/Casts Operators
Using type conversion operators taught me how to change the behaviour of the operator. It
seems the output or logic does not have to relate to the type operators identifier when
overloading within my DIY.

Operator Overloading
Most of my overloads were binary overloads. I learned how to create overloads to accomodate
specific interactions with values, variables, and objects.

Implementing Type & Operator Overload
markMain.cpp implemented type cast overloading + operator overloading. This helped in
understanding how these functions work via it's original code. Essentially, this helps the
students understand the abstraction behind the scenes.
