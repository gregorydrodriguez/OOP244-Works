Templates
Templates are an organized and powerful way to create reusable code. Templates are similar to overloading,
but with less lines of code. In class we learn that a template is like a blueprint that we define.
At compile time, the compiler generates the code with the specific arguments.

Typename
Typename is a keyword that represents a primitive (int, char, etc.) or composite type (classes, objects, etc.).
The compiler will replace Typename with the appropriate type depending on the arguments provided.

Functions implemented in workshop 10

bool search()
The templated bool search function requires one template class (T)
and takes in a random key type (U). Essentially, this function
will not work without a template class. This template function
will only work if the objects passing through have equivalency
overloads, for example "==" operator overload.

listArrayElements()
This templated function requires an object that inherits
the shift operator overload from the base class "ReadWrite".
Essentially, employee, car, and student are derived from ReadWrite.
