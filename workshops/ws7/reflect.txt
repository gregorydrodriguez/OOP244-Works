ws7 - Inheritance

Parent(Base) & Child(Derived) Classes
The child class can inherit the attributes and methods of it's parent/Base
class. This means you don't have to create new attributes/methods, due to the
child/derived class inheriting these members.

Parent Constructor Call
You can reuse code for the child constructor by calling the parent's constructor.

Protected Members 
protected members are similar to private members, with the exception that
child/derived classes have access to these members.
