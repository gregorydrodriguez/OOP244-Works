I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

The Rule of 3 - Copy Constructor

The copy constructor is implemented to deep copy the values of one object to a another object. This requires making sure the object receiving the
the new values is first set to an empty state. To prevent repetitive code, we implement our object methods into the copy constructor. This will
prove useful in our copy assignment overload.

The Rule of 3 - Copy Assignment

The copy assignment overloads the '=' operator. Similar to the copy constructor we set the current object to a safe empty state. We then deep copy
all of the values with the help of some of our other functions that take care of the abstraction.

The Rule of 3 - Destructor

Simply deallocates memory from the heap

this vs *this

I had a lot of issues, because I was using this instead of *this. This created segmentation faults during compilation. this passes the pointer, while
*this passes the values.

istr.ignore()

In getFile(), I had forgot to implement istr.ignore to clean up after myself and spent hours trying to debug. This function will clear the input buffer 
via the istr object.
